   <ol>
       <b><li>
        Marinate the chicken for 20-30 minutes  
          </li></b>
          <p>To prepare this mouth-watering biryani recipe😋, you have to marinate the chicken🍗. 
             For the same, take a large bowl and add Greek yoghurt in it along with turmeric, 
             chili powder along with salt as per your taste in a small bowl. Mix well using a spoon 
             and then, add the chicken thighs in the mixture and rub with this mixture. 
             Keep aside for about 20-30 minutes🕡, so that the yogurt mixture is properly absorbed 
             by the chicken. Also, soak saffron in the milk to make saffron milk and keep aside.</p>

        <b><li>
            Saute onions🧄 and tomatoes for 2-3 minutes🕡  
           </li></b>

               Add cumin seeds and green cardamom in it and saute for about 2 minutes. Once done,
               immediately add the sliced onion and fry for 2-3 minutes straight. Make sure you don't
               burn it, so when the onion starts to get brown in color, add tomatoes🍅 and tomato puree
               and fry for another 5 minutes.</p>

               frying the mixture yet again for a minute. Then, add coriander powder and turn the
                flame to medium-low while stirring and cooking the masala. Quickly, add the

   <h2 style="font-size:170%; font-family:verdana;">Description of Mughlai Chicken Dum Biryani after all done</h2>
   <p>When you raise the lid on a pot of good biryani, the Indian equivalent of arroz con pollo or paella, the smell should beguile you: Chicken, butter and spices should dominate, followed by the subtle aroma of basmati rice. You might even smell the salt. Good coarse salt does not hurt either, and the better the chicken, the happier you will be when you bite into it. Long-grained rice flavored with exotic spices, such as saffron, is layered with chicken, vegetables, and a thick gravy.</p>
